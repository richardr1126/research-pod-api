query: Best estimates for global warming and climate change

Recent research on global warming and climate change has significantly advanced our understanding of climate sensitivity, which is a critical parameter for predicting future climate change. Here are the key findings and developments based on the provided context and recent papers:

1. **Historical Context and Early Estimates**:
 - The first estimate of climate sensitivity was made by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, who calculated the atmospheric temperature change with a doubling of CO₂ concentration (Arrhenius, 1896).
 - The development of atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) in the 1960s and 1970s, such as those by Manabe and Wetherald (1967, 1975), allowed for more sophisticated estimates of climate sensitivity.

2. **Range of Climate Sensitivity Estimates**:
 - Early GCMs in the 1970s estimated climate sensitivity to be between 1.5-4.5°C (Charney, 1979).
 - The IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) refined this range to 2-5.1°C, but noted that the earlier NAS range still encompassed current model estimates.
 - The most recent IPCC assessment (2007) concluded that climate sensitivity is \"likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5°C\" (IPCC, 2007).

3. **Modern Constraints on Climate Sensitivity**:
 - Gregory et al. (2002) estimated climate sensitivity with a lower limit of 1.6°C, based on the rate of heat uptake by the ocean.
 - Forster and Gregory (2006) used satellite measurements of radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere to constrain climate sensitivity to a range of 1-4°C.
 - These estimates do not include the albedo forcing due to changes in land cover, which could have significant regional impacts (Betts, 2001; Brovkin et al., 2006; Davin et al., 2007).

4. **Model Validation and Historical Comparisons**:
 - Models are validated against the instrumental record, which increases confidence in their estimates of climate sensitivity (Barnett et al., 2001; Yokohata et al., 2005).
 - Comparing model simulations of the historic period with observations helps constrain the range of climate sensitivity estimates.

5. **Recent Comprehensive Assessments**:
 - Sherwood et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive assessment of Earth's climate sensitivity using multiple lines of evidence, concluding that the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is likely between 2.6°C and 3.9°C, with a best estimate of around 3°C (Sherwood et al., 2020, Reviews of Geophysics).
 - This study highlights the importance of integrating various observational and modeling approaches to reduce uncertainties in climate sensitivity estimates.

6. **Challenges and Future Directions**:
 - The persistence of large uncertainties in climate sensitivity poses significant challenges for planning and adaptation to future climate change.
 - Efforts to narrow the range of estimates or quantify the probability of climate sensitivity within a given range are ongoing, with a focus on improving the representation of key processes in climate models and leveraging new observational data.

In summary, recent research has refined the estimates of climate sensitivity and highlighted the importance of integrating multiple lines of evidence to reduce uncertainties. The best estimate of climate sensitivity remains around 3°C, with a likely range of 2-4.5°C, but ongoing efforts aim to further constrain this range and improve the reliability of climate predictions.
